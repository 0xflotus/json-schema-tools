# Contributing to Cloudflare's JSON Schema Tools

Thank you for your interest in our tools!  We welcome contributions to this project.

* Please check the [open issues](https://github.com/cloudflare/json-schema-tools/issues) first!
* Open an issue for any proposal more complex than a comment typo or similar (you can just PR typo fixes)
* Once a project member approves the issue, do all of your work in your own fork and open a PR
* Your PR **must** include tests, including test output with coverage numbers, if the package already has tests, or is a new package
* For existing packages without tests, we will advise on any testing requirements when we approve the issue

See the [README](README.md) for a guide to the various packages and how to run them.
